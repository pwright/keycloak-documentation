<section><section id="_red_hat_single_sign_on_continuous_delivery_7_3_cd04"><h2>Red Hat Single Sign-On Continuous Delivery 7.3.CD04</h2></section><section id="_signature_spi"><h2>Signature SPI</h2><div class="paragraph"><p>The Signature SPI makes it possible to plug-in additional signature algorithms. This enables additional signatures and also enables changing how signatures are generated. For example, using this allows using an HSM device to sign tokens.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/tnorimat">tnorimat</a> for contributing a signficant part of this work.</p></div></section><section id="_new_signature_algorithms"><h2>New Signature Algorithms</h2><div class="paragraph"><p>Alongside the Signature SPI there is now also support for additional signature algorithms.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Keycloak now has support for RS256, RS384, RS512, ES256, ES384, ES512, HS256, HS384 and HS512.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ES256/384/512) are very interesting as they provide similar
security properties as RSA signatures, but use significantly less CPU.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>HMAC (HS256/384/512) are also very useful when you do not want your application to verify the signature itself.
Since these are symmetric signatures only Keycloak is able to verify the signature, which requires the
application to use the token introspection endpoint to verify tokens.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/tnorimat">tnorimat</a> for contributing a signficant part of this work.</p></div></section><section id="_better_audience_support_for_openid_connect_clients"><h2>Better Audience Support for OpenID Connect clients</h2><div class="paragraph"><p>It is now possible to specify the audiences in the tokens issued for OpenID Connect clients.

<section><section id="_red_hat_single_sign_on_continuous_delivery_7_3_cd03"><h2>Red Hat Single Sign-On Continuous Delivery 7.3.CD03</h2></section><section id="_hostname_spi"><h2>Hostname SPI</h2><div class="paragraph"><p>The hostname SPI introduces a more flexible way to configure the hostname for Red Hat Single Sign-On. There are two
built-in providers. The first is request, which uses the request headers to determine the hostname. The second
is fixed, which allows configuring a fixed hostname. The latter makes sure that only valid hostnames can be
used and also allows internal applications to invoke Red Hat Single Sign-On through an alternative URL.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>For more details refer to the threat mitigation section in the <a href="https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_single_sign-on_continuous_delivery/6/html-single/server_administration_guide/">Server Administration Guide</a>.</p></div></section><section id="_x509_client_authenticator"><h2>X509 Client Authenticator</h2><div class="paragraph"><p>The newly added Client Authenticator uses X509 Client Certificates and Mutual TLS to secure a connection from the client. In addition to that
the Keycloak Server validates Subject DN field of the client&#8217;s certificate.</p></div></section><section id="_performance_improvements_to_authorization_services"><h2>Performance improvements to Authorization Services</h2><div class="paragraph"><p>For this release, we improved policy evaluation performance across the board, increasing reliability and throughput. The main
changes we did were related with trying to optimize the policy evaluation path by avoiding unnecessary flows and collect decisions
as soon as they happen. We also introduced a policy decision cache on a per request basis, avoiding redundant decisions from policies
previously evaluated.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>We are also working on other layers of cache which should give a much better experience. See <a href="https://issues.jboss.org/browse/KEYCLOAK-7952">KEYCLOAK-7952</a>.</p></div></section><section id="_choosing_the_response_mode_when_obtaining_permissions_from_the_server"><h2>Choosing the response mode when obtaining permissions from the server</h2><div class="paragraph"><p>In previous versions, permissions were always returned from the server using standard OAuth2 response, containing the access and refresh tokens. In this release,
clients can use a <code>response_mode</code> parameter to specify how the server should respond to an authorization request. This parameter accepts two values:</p></div>
<div class="ulist"><ul><li><p><code>decision</code></p><div class="paragraph"><p>Indicating that responses should only contain a flag indicating whether or not permissions were granted by the server. Otherwise a <code>403</code> HTTP status code is returned.</p></div></li><li><p><code>permissions</code></p><div class="paragraph"><p>Indicating that a response should contain every single permission granted by the server using a JSON format.</p></div></li></ul></div></section><section id="_nodejs_policy_enforcer"><h2>NodeJS Policy Enforcer</h2><div class="paragraph"><p>The <a href="https://github.com/keycloak/keycloak-nodejs-connect">keycloak-nodejs-connect</a>, an adapter for NodeJS, now supports constructs to protect
resources based on decisions taken from the server. The new construct allows users to protect their resources using fine-grained permissions as follows:</p></div>
<pre class="highlight listingblock"><code class="js language-js">app.get('/protected/resource', keycloak.enforcer('resource:view'), function (req, res) {
  res.json({message: 'access granted'});
});</code></pre></section><section id="_support_hosted_domain_for_google_logins"><h2>Support hosted domain for Google logins</h2><div class="paragraph"><p>Login with Google now supports the <code>hd</code> parameter to restrict Google logins to a specific hosted domain at Google. When
this is specified in the identity provider any login from a different domain is rejected.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/brushmate">brushmate</a> for the contribution.</p></div></section><section id="_escape_unsafe_tags_in_html_output"><h2>Escape unsafe tags in HTML output</h2><div class="paragraph"><p>Most HTML output is already escaped for HTML tags, but there are some places where HTML tags are permitted.
These are only where admin access is needed to update the value. Even though it would require admin access to update such
fields we have added an extra layer of defence and are now escaping unsafe elements like <code>&lt;script&gt;</code>.</p></div></section><section id="_browser_tab_support_for_cordova"><h2>Browser tab support for Cordova</h2><div class="paragraph"><p>We now have support for using browser tab and universal links in the JavaScript adapter for Cordova. This enables SSO
between multiple applications as well as increases security.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/gtudan">gtudan</a> for the contribution.</p></div></section><section id="_saml_adapter_multitenancy_support"><h2>SAML adapter multitenancy support</h2><div class="paragraph"><p>The SAML adapter can support multi-tenancy now just like the built in adapter for OpenID Connect.</p></div></section><section id="_an_option_to_create_claims_with_dots_in_them"><h2>An option to create claims with dots (.) in them</h2><div class="paragraph"><p>In previous versions, it was not possible to create claims in the token using a claim name containing a dot (.) character. Now it is
possible to escape the dot character in the configuration, so a claim name with the dot character can be used.</p></div></section><section id="_making_spring_boot_2_the_default_starter"><h2>Making Spring Boot 2 the default starter</h2><div class="paragraph"><p>Starting with release 4.1, the Spring Boot starter will be based on the Spring Boot 2 adapter. If you are using an older Spring Boot version, the keycloak-legacy-spring-boot-starter is available.</p></div></section></section>
<section><section id="_red_hat_single_sign_on_continuous_delivery_7_3_cd02"><h2>Red Hat Single Sign-On Continuous Delivery 7.3.CD02</h2></section><section id="_client_scopes_and_support_for_oauth_2_scope_parameter"><h2>Client Scopes and support for OAuth 2 scope parameter</h2><div class="paragraph"><p>We added support for Client Scopes, which replaces Client Templates. Client Scopes are a more flexible approach and also provides
better support for the OAuth <code>scope</code> parameter.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>There are changes related to Client Scopes to the consent screen. The list on the consent screen is now linked to client scopes
instead of protocol mappers and roles.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>See the documentation and migration guide for more details.</p></div></section><section id="_oauth_2_certificate_bound_access_tokens"><h2>OAuth 2 Certificate Bound Access Tokens</h2><div class="paragraph"><p>We now have a partial implementation of the specification
<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-oauth-mtls-08">OAuth 2.0 Mutual TLS Client Authentication and Certificate Bound Access Tokens</a> .
More accurately we have support for the Certificate Bound Access Tokens. If your confidential client is able to use 2-way SSL,
Red Hat Single Sign-On will be able to add the hash of the client certificate into the tokens issued for the client. At this moment,
it&#8217;s just  the Red Hat Single Sign-On itself, which verifies the token hashes (for example during <code>refresh token</code> requests).
We plan to add support to adapters as well. We also plan to add support for Mutual TLS Client Authentication.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/tnorimat">tnorimat</a> for the contribution.</p></div></section><section id="_authorization_services"><h2>Authorization Services</h2><h3>UMA 2.0 Support</h3><div class="paragraph"><p>UMA 2.0 is now supported for Authorization Services. Check the documentation for more details
if you are coming from previous versions of Red Hat Single Sign-On.</p></div>
<h4>User-Managed Access through the Red Hat Single Sign-On Account Service</h4><div class="paragraph"><p>Now end-users are able to manage their resources and the permissions associated with them through the Red Hat Single Sign-On Account Service.
From there, resource owners can now check their resources, share resources with another users as well approve requests from other users.</p></div>
<h4>Asynchronous Authorization Flow</h4><div class="paragraph"><p>When using UMA, client applications can now choose whether or not an authorization request should start an authorization flow
to ask for the resource owner approval. This functionality allows applications to ask for resource owner
approval when trying to access one of his resources on behalf of another user.</p></div>
<h4>User-Managed Permission API</h4><div class="paragraph"><p>Resource servers are now capable of associating additional policies to resources owned by a particular user. The new API provides
operations to manage these permissions using different policy types such as role, group, user, client or a condition using JavaScript.</p></div>
<h3>Pushed Claims</h3><div class="paragraph"><p>Clients applications are now able to send arbitrary claims to Red Hat Single Sign-On along with an authorization request in order to
evaluate permissions based on these claims. This is a very handy addition when access
should be granted (or denied) in the scope of a specific transaction or based on information about the runtime.</p></div>
<h3>Resource Attributes</h3><div class="paragraph"><p>It is now possible to associated attributes with resources protected by Red Hat Single Sign-On and use these same attributes to evaluate permissions
from your policies.</p></div>
<h3>Policy enforcer now accepts regular access tokens</h3><div class="paragraph"><p>In some situations, you may want to just send regular access tokens to a resource server but still be able to enforce policies on these resources.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>One of the main changes introduced by this release is that you are no longer required to exchange access tokens with RPTs in
order to access resources protected by a resource server (when not using UMA). Depending on how the policy enforcer is configured on the resource server side, you can just send regular
access tokens as a bearer token and permissions will still be enforced.</p></div>
<h3>Policy enforcer can now load resources from the server on-demand</h3><div class="paragraph"><p>Until now, when deploying an application configured with a <code>policy-enforcer</code>, the policy enforcer would either load all protected paths
from the server or just map these paths from the adapter configuration. Users can now decide to load paths on-demand from the server and avoid
map these resources in the adapter configuration. Depending on how many protected resources you have this functionality can also improve the time to
deploy an application.</p></div>
<h3>Policy enforcer now supports configuring the resource cache</h3><div class="paragraph"><p>In order to avoid unnecessary hits to the server, the policy enforcer caches the mapping between protected resources and their corresponding paths
in your application. Users can now configure the behaviour of the cache or even completely disable it.</p></div>
<h3>Claim Information Points</h3><div class="paragraph"><p>The <code>policy-enforcer</code> definition on the adapters (<code>keycloak.json</code>) was also updated to support the concept of pushed claims. There
you have the concept of a <code>claim-information-point</code> which can be set to push claims from different sources such as the HTTP request or even
from an external HTTP service.</p></div>
<h3>Improvements to the Evaluation API</h3><div class="paragraph"><p>The Evaluation API used to implement policies in Red Hat Single Sign-On, especially JavaScript and Drools policies, provides now methods to:</p></div>
<div class="ulist"><ul><li><p>Access information from the current realm such as check for user roles, groups and attributes</p></li><li><p>Push back arbitrary claims to the resource server in order to provide additional information on how a specific permissions should
be enforced</p></li></ul></div></section><section id="_authorization_services_2"><h2>Authorization Services</h2><h3>UMA 2.0</h3><div class="paragraph"><p>UMA 2.0 is now supported for Authorization Services, including support for users to manage user access through
the account management console. There are also other additions and improvements to authorization services.</p></div>
<h3>Pushed Claims</h3><div class="paragraph"><p>Clients can now push additional claims and have them used by policies when evaluating permissions.</p></div>
<h3>Resource Attributes</h3><div class="paragraph"><p>It is now possible to define attributes on resources in order to have them used by policies when evaluating permissions.</p></div></section><section id="_themes_and_theme_resources"><h2>Themes and Theme Resources</h2><div class="paragraph"><p>It is now possible to hot-deploy themes to Keycloak through a regular provider deployment. We have also added support for theme resources, which allows adding additional templates and resources without creating a theme. This is useful for custom authenticators that require additional pages to be added to the authentication flow.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>We have also added support to override the theme for specific clients. If that is not adequate for your needs, then there is also a new Theme Selector SPI that allows you to implement custom logic to select the theme.</p></div></section><section id="_instagram_identity_provider"><h2>Instagram Identity Provider</h2><div class="paragraph"><p>We have added support to login with Instagram. Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/hguerrero">hguerrero</a> for the contribution.</p></div></section><section id="_search_by_user_id_in_admin_console"><h2>Search by User ID in Admin Console</h2><div class="paragraph"><p>To search for a user by id in the admin console you previously had to edit the URL. It is now possible to search
directly in the user search field.</p></div></section><section id="_adapters"><h2>Adapters</h2><h3>Spring Boot 2</h3><div class="paragraph"><p>We now have support for Spring Boot 2.</p></div>
<h3>Fuse 7</h3><div class="paragraph"><p>We now have support for Fuse 7.</p></div>
<h3>JavaScript - Native Promise Support</h3><div class="paragraph"><p>The JavaScript adapter now supports native promises. It retains support for the old style promises as well.
Both can be used interchangeably.</p></div>
<h3>JavaScript - Cordova Options</h3><div class="paragraph"><p>It is now possible to pass Cordova-specific options to login and other methods in the JavaScript adapter.
